# Portfolio Tracker Backend

This repository contains server logic for Portfolio Tracker arduino device (see PortfolioTracker-Arduino). You should use this backend with telegram bot (see PortfolioTracker-Bot) as an admin client (to add accounts and transactions) or without by just calling endpoints as you need.

Startup:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Roadmap

- Add endpoints documentation
- Add support for SOL and TRX
